<header><h1>Why I Want to be a Doctor<h1></header>
<p>As my future career, I want to be a doctor  More specifically, a surgeon.  I do not 100% know my specific field I want to
go into, but it is between General or trauma.  General surgery mainly deals with the bowels and mid-section of the human body.  
For example, if you need your pancreas out, you would go to a general surgeon.  Now, let's say you get shot.  Who do you go to?  
Obviously you go to the emergency room.  But, what most people don't realize, is that when they go into emergency surgery, the regular
 ER doctors are not the ones who preform it.  That is where trauma surgeons come in.</p>
