<header><h1>Degree Types That Are Needed<h1></header>

<h2>Associates</h2>
<p>This degree takes only two years to complete.  People typically go to community colleges to acieve this level of education,
which helps people not spend a lot of money.  People also have the option to earn this in high school along with their GED.  
The way to do this is seeing if your school has a Dual Credit program with your local community college.  This degree can give a 
person a very limited ammount of good paying jobs, but most people will only be able to get minimum wage work.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Bachelors</h2>
<p>This degree is a four year degree.  But,  most people don't know that it can be earned in less time.  If you do the dual credit oppurtunity 
in high school, you can see what classes can transfer into your major and end up cutting those classes out because you already did them. 
 Typically, people need to go to University to earn this level of education.  You can get a lot of different jobs with this degree that 
 are good paying.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Masters</h2>
<p>This degree also requires four years at a University.  This degree will open many more jobs than a Bachelors, and people earn a lot more
 money than they would be able to with a bachelors.  For example, teachers get a raise if they earn their masters degrees while they are working 
 in that school system or district.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Doctorate</h2>
<p>Earning a doctorate is weird.  It all depends on what feild you are going into and how you acquire this very high-level degree.  
For example, in order for a general surgeon to earn their doctorate, or MD, they need to do four years of residancy (AKA internship).
  Earning this looks different for everyone and can vary from person to person.</p>
