<header><h1>Good Schools I am Considering for Each Degree<h1></header>
<h2>UNK</h2>
<p>Located in Kearney, NE, this school is rated one of the cheapest schools in the nation.  The entire costs for the year 
add up to about $20,000 including tuition, room, food, and miscellaneous.  They have many different programs for all kinds of different 
feilds.  </p>

<h2>UNO</h2>
<p>This school is in Omaha, NE.  This school is slightly more expensive than UNK, but only by a couple thousand.  This school, in my opinion,
 has better programs and oppurtunities than either school mentioned here.  But it is in a bigger city and may not be for everyone.</p>
<hr>
<h2>UNL</h2>
<p>This school is the most expensive of the three($30,000).  This school is located in Nebraska's capitol, Lincoln.  In a way, 
that explains why it is so expensive.  They have some good programs, but I don't know if dual credit transfers.</p>
