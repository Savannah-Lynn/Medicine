<header><h1>Different Hospitals I Want to Go To<h1></header>
<h2>Johns Hopkins</h2>
<p>Located in Baltimore, Maryland, this Ivy League school is on the top of my list for attending med school.  
Because it is Ivy League, it is extreamly expensive, but I am hoping that I will save enough during my 8 years in state.
  It has an amizing program and they release exeptional doctors from their mold.  I want to be one of those great doctors one day.</p>

<h2>Tulane</h2>
<p>This school is located in New Orleans, Luisiana.  I love the south and I would love to go back to the culture and experiance a whole
 different culture within the southern community.  It is my back up plan for if Johns Hopkins falls through.  It has a very good program, 
 and they have a good team within the community as a whole and the emergency response team.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Harvard</h2>
<p>Another good school located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  It is also Ivy League, but it is not my first choice.  It has a lower aceptance 
rate than Johns Hopkins.  They also have a good program but it is also too expensive for me personally.  </p>
